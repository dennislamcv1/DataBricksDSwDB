# Data Science with Databricks for Data Analysts


## About this Specialization

This specialization is intended for data analysts looking to expand their toolbox for working with data. Traditionally, data analysts have used tools like relational databases, CSV files, and SQL programming, among others, to perform their daily workflows. In this specialization, you will leverage existing skills to learn new ones that will allow you to utilize advanced technologies not traditionally linked to this role - technologies like Databricks and Apache Spark. By the end of this specialization, you'll be able to solve real-world business problems with Databricks and the most popular machine learning techniques.

## Applied Learning Project

In this specialization, you'll complete a series of hands-on lab assignments and projects. The lab assignments will allow you to test-drive Databricks and Apache Spark to streamline today's most popular data science workflows. You will also apply the latest data science strategies to complete and assess your very own data science project.
